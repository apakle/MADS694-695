# SIADS 694 & 695 - Milestone II

Supervised and unsupervised machine learning using asteroid data (close-approaches of small bodies) from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

Asteroids are small, metallic or rocky bodies without atmospheres that orbit the sun and come in various sizes and shapes. They formed from collisions of proto-planets in the early solar system and contain valuable information about our solar system's origins and the evolution of life on Earth. Over 1 million asteroids have been identified, but many more remain undiscovered, and they may contain rare minerals and organic compounds. Asteroids are also of interest because of the potential danger they pose if they collide with Earth, and their study using machine learning models can help predict their trajectories and better prepare us for future encounters.
